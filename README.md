# BMI Calculator

A simple Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms). It also classifies the BMI result into categories: **Underweight**, **Normal**, or **Overweight**.

## Features
- Takes user input for height (m) and weight (kg)
- Calculates BMI using the standard formula
- Classifies the result into:
  - Underweight (BMI < 18.5)
  - Normal (18.5 ≤ BMI ≤ 24.9)
  - Overweight (BMI > 24.9)

## Formula
\[
BMI = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}
\]
